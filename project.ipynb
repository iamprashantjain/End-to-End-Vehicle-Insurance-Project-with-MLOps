    "- TOML (Tom’s Obvious, Minimal Language): It’s a simple configuration file format (like JSON or YAML) but is easier to read and write. \n",
    "- TOML is becoming the standard for Python packaging metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Why pyproject.toml is important:`\n",
    "- It was introduced with PEP 518 to modernize Python package building. Previously, everything was done using setup.py \n",
    "- but now pyproject.toml allows for more flexibility, better dependency management, and cleaner project configuration.\n",
    "- It centralizes metadata about the project: project name, version, dependencies, authors, etc.\n",
    "- It supports various build systems (like setuptools, poetry, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Explaining sections of pyproject.toml:`\n",
    "- [project]: Defines the basic project information (name, version, description, authors).\n",
    "- [tool.setuptools]: Specifies that setuptools is being used to build the project.\n",
    "- [tool.setuptools.dynamic]: Links the external files (like requirements.txt) to dynamically pull dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- setup.py with the advent of pyproject.toml: Some tasks previously handled by setup.py (like metadata) are now managed by pyproject.toml. However, setup.py can still be used, especially if you have complex build steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `How do setup.py, pyproject.toml, and requirements.txt work together?`\n",
    "- pyproject.toml: It’s now the central place for project metadata. Instead of defining your dependencies and project information in setup.py, you can define them in pyproject.toml.\n",
    "- As we did in your project, the line [tool.setuptools.dynamic] dependencies = {file = \"requirements.txt\"} links your requirements.txt file to the TOML file, so when the project is built, the dependencies are fetched from requirements.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "- setup.py: While it’s still used for custom builds and configurations, most of the basic functionality (like metadata and dependencies) is being transferred to pyproject.toml. You might still keep a minimal setup.py if you have custom build steps, but for many projects, it’s not necessary anymore with pyproject.toml.\n",
    "\n",
    "- requirements.txt: It lists all project dependencies and their versions.\n",
    "- When you run pip install -r requirements.txt, it ensures that all dependencies are installed. The pyproject.toml file can reference it (as we did) so that package dependencies are automatically pulled from there.\n",
